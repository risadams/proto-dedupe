# Feature Specification: Tarball Deduplication System

**Feature Branch**: `001-python-application-to`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "python application to help remove duplicate entries from tarballs"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A system administrator manages a central log server that receives nightly tarballs containing logs and text files from multiple servers. Over time, due to log rotation and other factors, these tarballs accumulate duplicate files, wasting storage space and making log analysis inefficient. The administrator needs an automated process to identify and track duplicate files within these tarballs using content-based hashing, enabling informed decisions about deduplication.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a tarball containing log files from multiple servers, **When** the system processes the tarball, **Then** it extracts each file, calculates SHA256 checksums, and stores metadata in the database
2. **Given** a file with content that already exists in the database, **When** the system processes it, **Then** it identifies it as a duplicate and records the duplicate occurrence
3. **Given** tarballs from different dates containing the same log file, **When** both are processed, **Then** the system detects the duplicate and maintains a record of both occurrences
4. **Given** the system has processed multiple tarballs, **When** an administrator queries for duplicates, **Then** they can see which files are duplicated across which tarballs and servers

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a tarball is corrupted or cannot be extracted?
- How does the system handle very large files that might cause memory issues during hashing?
- What occurs when the database is unavailable during processing?
- How are nested tar files or compressed files within tarballs handled?
- What happens when file timestamps are missing or invalid?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST extract and examine the contents of tarball files
- **FR-002**: System MUST calculate content-based checksums for each file within tarballs
- **FR-003**: System MUST store file metadata in a database including checksum, hostname, tarball name, filename, timestamps, and hash algorithm
- **FR-004**: System MUST identify duplicate files based on content checksums
- **FR-005**: System MUST track which tarball and server each file originated from
- **FR-006**: System MUST record timestamps for both the original file and when it was processed
- **FR-007**: System MUST support configurable hashing algorithms (default SHA256)
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle multiple tarballs from the same server across different time periods
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a way to query and report on duplicate files
- **FR-010**: System MUST log processing activities and errors for troubleshooting

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: System MUST process large tarballs (several GB) without excessive memory usage
- **PR-002**: System MUST complete processing of a typical nightly tarball within reasonable time limits
- **PR-003**: Database operations MUST be efficient enough to handle thousands of file records per tarball

### Data Requirements
- **DR-001**: Database MUST store checksums with sufficient length for chosen hash algorithm
- **DR-002**: Database MUST maintain referential integrity between files and their source tarballs
- **DR-003**: System MUST preserve original file timestamps and processing timestamps
- **DR-004**: Database schema MUST support querying duplicates efficiently

### Technical Requirements
- **TR-001**: System MUST be implemented using Python 3.12 or later
- **TR-002**: System MUST use PostgreSQL as the database backend

### Key Entities
- **File Record**: Represents a file found within a tarball, with attributes including checksum, original filename, file size, timestamps, and content hash
- **Tarball Record**: Represents a source tarball file, with attributes including filename, hostname/server origin, processing timestamp, and total file count
- **Duplicate Group**: Represents a collection of files with identical content checksums, enabling duplicate identification and reporting
- **Processing Log**: Represents system activities, errors, and processing statistics for audit and troubleshooting purposes
